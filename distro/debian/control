Description: Jaxer, the world's first Ajax server from Aptana.
 Jaxer is a server-side JavaScript application engine which enables
 the development of complete, sophisticated Ajax applications in JavaScript.
 Jaxer is licensed under the GPL and leverages the ubiquitous Mozilla engine
 used in Firefox 3. This means that Jaxer is fully compatible with the latest
 JavaScript standards, including access to all of the familiar features from
 Date to Math to window and document, and even JavaScript 1.5, 1.7, and 1.8,
 as well as Database, file and socket access, XMLHttpRequests,
 JSON and DOM scripting.
