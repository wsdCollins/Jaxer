Welcome To Jaxer, the Aptana Ajax Server.

Quick Start:

===== On Microsoft Windows:

The quickest way to get started using this standalone Jaxer package 
is to double click the StartServers.bat file. This will start JaxerManager and, 
if present in this package, the standalone Apache web server.

Hit any key in the DOS window that opened when you clicked the bat file 
to stop the servers and close the window. 

No software will be installed/altered on your machine outside of the folder
to which you unzipped the Jaxer package.


===== On Mac OS X:

On the Mac, just double-click on the 'Jaxer Launcher' application. By default,
this application will automatically start the integrated Apache 2.2 server,
it will start Jaxer, then open your default browser to the start page of the
Jaxer server.

Note, because Apache needs to live in a known location, Jaxer includes a special
compiled version of Apache that knows how to live in your /Applications/Aptana_Jaxer
folder. Because of this, the folder cannot be moved or placed anywhere else, otherwise
Apache will not be able to start.

To stop all servers and quit, just click on the Quit button of the Jaxer Launcher.

===== On Linux:
