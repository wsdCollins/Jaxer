This folder contains Jaxer, the Aptana Ajax Server.

To get started with Jaxer, it's easiest to start with Aptana Studio,
which embeds Jaxer and offers samples, content assist, specialized views,
and so on. You can also use the standalone Jaxer Package, which
includes this folder as well as a pre-configured Apache server and
scripts to start and stop everything.

To update your Jaxer, update your Aptana Studio, or for the standalone
package visit http://www.aptana.com/jaxer/download and see the instructions.
