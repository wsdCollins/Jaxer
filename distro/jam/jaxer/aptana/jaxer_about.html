<h2>About Jaxer</h2>
<p>
	Jaxer is the Aptana Ajax Server, that's also built into Aptana Studio. Jaxer allows you to execute some of your Ajax code - HTML, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequests, etc. - on the server, before the page is served or during a callback. Now you can write your entire application, or your presentation layer, using a single, familiar Ajax codebase. It's standards-based and open-source. And if your page doesn't use any Jaxer features, it will be unaffected by running it through Jaxer.
</p>
<p>
	Rich, "Ajax-style" web sites and applications offer tremendous advantages over both static web sites and desktop applications. But they can be difficult to develop, maintain, and expand.
</p>
<p>
	Many of the difficulties on the client side are alleviated by Ajax libraries such as jQuery, ext, and Dojo, and by development environments such as the Aptana Studio development environement.
</p>
<p>
	Jaxer completes the picture by offering a powerful <b>Ajax Server</b>.
	With Jaxer, you can:
	<ul>
		<li>
			develop your entire site or application using only standards-based DHTML, JavaScript, and CSS;
		</li>
		<li>
			prepare the HTML DOM on the server before the page is served,
			using the same techniques and libraries you would use on the client;
		</li>
		<li>
			call server-side JavaScript functions directly from client-side JavaScript;
		</li>
		<li>
			and validate your data with the same code on both the server and the client.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Where do I start?</h3>

	<li>
		<i>Optionally</i>, set up your Aptana Studio by creating a Jaxer project to ease creating web content
	</li>
	<li>
		Then <a href="javascript: ContentManager.fetchContent('apps_and_tools.html');" title="Samples and Tools">browse the existing apps</a>
		to see some simple or more involved Jaxer code, or just create an html page in the public folder in your Jaxer installation
		and start adding Jaxer <span class="tech-name">&lt;script&nbsp;runat="server"&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</span> code.
